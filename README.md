To use the spam detection project, follow these steps and refer to the key files provided with the project:

## Quick Usage Guide
1. **Install dependencies**  
   Run:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
   This installs all required Python packages for the project.[1]
2. **Train the model**  
   Run:  
   `python train_model.py`  
   This will train the spam detection model and save it for later use.[1]
3. **Test predictions (single email)**  
   Run:  
   `python predict.py`  
   Use this script to input emails and get spam classification with confidence scores.[1]
4. **Web application**  
   Run:  
   `python app.py`  
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` for a visual interface and REST API.[2]
5. **Batch processing**  
   Run:  
   `python batch_process.py Emails.csv`  
   Processes multiple emails and generates reports.[3]
6. **Review documentation**
